## 3.4.1 2017-07-06

* Backwards compatibility fix for seneca-amqp-transport 2.2.0 (legacy.meta=true)


## 3.4.0 2017-07-03

* Verified working against Node 8.
* Added github standard code of conduct.
* Now using https://github.com/prettier/prettier as code format.
* Refactored message and reply meta data, making message tracking much easier; Actions and callbacks get a third parameter `meta`, that has all the details.
* Minor refactor of error handling so that errors are passed-through; intended for 4.x, enable with legacy.error=false.
* Next-generation transport (2X faster, new simpler API for transport writers) included in core Seneca; only http transport written; intended to be default transport in 4.x, enable with legacy.transport=false.
* As part of next-generation transport, a new message protocol that gives the message data prioity as a JSON object, and placed Seneca meta data into the meta$ property.
* Action cache replaced by action history utility, making a decoupled seneca.reply mehtod possible (as used (and needed) by next-generation transport).
* Fixed root deprecation warning; Better, but incomplete refactor of source files; some minor fixes;


## 3.3.0 2017-02-07

* Action callback can omit Error parameter (hapi style): http://senecajs.org/api/#method-add
* Minor updates for consistency with new API docs: http://senecajs.org/api
* Updated use-plugin to 0.3.2.
* Plugin options are now consistent with global options after plugin load.


## 3.2.0 2016-09-27

* Made logging safely stringify input.
* Fixed memory leak / timeout bug in gate-executor.


## 3.1.0 2016-09-16

## 3.0.0 2016-08-26

* Refactored 'old' logging into it's own external plugin; seneca-legacy-logger.

* Replaced large swathes custom code with Lodash to improve speed and reliability.
* Exposed parsepattern function via seneca.util.parsepattern as required by seneca-chain to function.
* Removed all 'dead' code marked legacy. Updated other parts of codebase with legacy comments for v.next.
* Removed default settings for seneca-admin as it is not a default loaded plugin.
* Set `options.actcache.active` to be false by default. Disables actcache feature by default.
* Moved `close_signals` from `options.internal` to `options.system`.
* Moved `catchall` from `options.internal` to `options.system`.
* Removed `options.schema` as it was only partially checking and needs a rethink.
* Removed mem-store as a required dependency in the package.
* Devolved store logic in 'store.js' fully to seneca-entity. Entites are now 'fully removed'.
* Devolved chain functionality into seneca-chain and removed from library. Moved all related tests.
* Devolved pin functionality into seneca-pin and removed from library. Moved all related tests.
* Removed seneca-web as a default loaded plugin. Removed related tests. Removed from package.

* Removed LTS doc as it gives the wrong information. Website update to follow.
* Updated all dependencies. Locked deps because of `0.x` support have been updated too.
* Modified tests to account for breaking changes in both lab and code after updating to latest.
* Updated eslint-config-seneca with local rules and removed. Corrected peer dependency issues around linting plugins.
* Annotations are no longer stored in the repo and must be generated locally. Annotations are found in `docs/annotated`
* Annotations now work for the whole library, not just `seneca.js`
* Coverage report now generates as `/docs/coverage.html` and is not stored in the repo.
* Coverage and Annotations can now be generated via `npm run coverage` and `npm run annotate` respectively.
* Paired back and updated travis file. Plugins are now tested via `seneca-test-rig` instead of with Seneca.
* Moved older examples into folders for clarity and added another 5 examples showing more concepts; see `docs/examples`
* Removed ALL redundant code files from `test` put stubs in `test/stubs` folder. All tests are now in the root.
* Added test to show how to use exportmap in plugins to export values and functions; see `/test/plugin.test.js:L23`
* Removed old release scripts in favour of `docs/examples/create-a-release.md` and using seneca-test-rig for plugin testing.
